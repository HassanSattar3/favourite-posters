# GitHub Pages Automated Deployment Plan

## Current Setup
- Project is configured with gh-pages package
- Homepage is set to: https://hassansattar3.github.io/favourite-posters
- Build and deploy scripts are configured in package.json

## Implementation Plan

1. Create GitHub Actions Workflow:
   - Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
   - Configure workflow to:
     - Trigger on push to main branch
     - Set up Node.js environment
     - Install dependencies
     - Build the project
     - Deploy to GitHub Pages

2. Workflow Details:
   ```yaml
   name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
   on:
     push:
       branches: [ main ]
   
   jobs:
     build-and-deploy:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - name: Checkout
           uses: actions/checkout@v4
         
         - name: Set up Node.js
           uses: actions/setup-node@v4
           with:
             node-version: '20'
             
         - name: Install dependencies
           run: npm ci
           
         - name: Build
           run: npm run build
           
         - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
           uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@v4
           with:
             branch: gh-pages
             folder: dist
   ```

3. Repository Settings:
   - Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
   - Set deployment source to "GitHub Actions"
   - Configure permissions for GitHub Actions

## Next Steps

1. Create the workflow file as specified above
2. Push to main branch to trigger initial deployment
3. Monitor the Actions tab in GitHub to ensure successful deployment
4. Verify the deployment at https://hassansattar3.github.io/favourite-posters

## Note
Once implemented, every push to the main branch will automatically:
1. Trigger the GitHub Actions workflow
2. Build the project
3. Deploy to GitHub Pages
4. Update the live site
